## üìù About

This project provides a visual and interactive way to understand how the Radix Sort algorithm works, supporting both LSD (Least Significant Digit) and MSD (Most Significant Digit) variants. It was created as part of a university assignment and is intended for learning and presentation purposes.

## üöÄ How it works

1. **Input**: Enter a list of positive integers separated by commas.
2. **Choose Algorithm**: Select either LSD or MSD Radix Sort.
3. **Start**: Click "Iniciar Algoritmo" to begin the visualization.
4. **Step-by-step**: Use "Pr√≥ximo Passo" to advance one step at a time, or "Execu√ß√£o Autom√°tica" for automatic progression.
5. **Reset**: Click "Reiniciar" to start over.

The visualization shows:

- The original array
- The current state of the array at each step
- Buckets used for sorting by digit
- Explanations for each step and progress bar
